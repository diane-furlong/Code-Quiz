# Homework


# Code-Quiz


## Description 

This project is a CWRU Coding Bootcamp homework assignment. This goal of this assignment is to create a timed quiz that covers the subject of coding. The HTML and CSS was provided, and the student was to write the JavaScript.<br>

The purpose of this homework assignment is to continue to practice JavaScript, along with practicing using Web APIs. The main new skill learned before being given this assignment was working with local storage in the web browser.<br>

The acceptance criteria and a description of how mine works is as follows:<br>

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz<br>
WHEN I click the start button<br>
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question<br>
Comments: This works.<br>
<br>
WHEN I answer a question<br>
THEN I am presented with another question<br>
Comments: This works.<br>
<br>
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly<br>
THEN time is subtracted from the clock<br>
Comments: This does not work. I've tried many different ways to no avail- this is something that I may need to work on with a tutor.<br>
<br>
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0<br>
THEN the game is over<br>
Comments: This works.<br>
<br>
WHEN the game is over<br>
THEN I can save my initials and score<br>
Comments: This does not yet work. I've gotten to work on this a little bit, but not to the point where the score shows up.<br>
